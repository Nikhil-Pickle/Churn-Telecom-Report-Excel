# Churn Telecom Report (Excel)

Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers discontinue their business with a company within a specific time frame.

In this project, I utilized Excel to analyze and explore a modified dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview).

I employed standard statistical analysis and chart visualization techniques to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis.

Key findings for customers who churned include:

- They were, on average, 10 years younger.
- They did not utilize the voicemail plan.
- They had daily phone charges that were approximately 15% higher.
- They spent almost 20% more time compared to non-churning customers.
